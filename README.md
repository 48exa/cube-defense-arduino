# cube-defense-arduino
Source code for the input device for 'Cube Defense', made in C++ with the Arduino + Teensy libraries

Extra documentation / explanation / a short written lecture in integer sizes can be found in [header.h](https://github.com/48exa/cube-defense-arduino/blob/main/header.h)

Teensy.ino is the main file. Run teensy as `Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick`.
You can see if the device works by checking `Control Panel -> Devices and Printers -> Serial/Keyboard/Mouse/Joystick Device -> Game controller settings -> Properties`. The buttons should light up when rotating the Rotary Encoder.
